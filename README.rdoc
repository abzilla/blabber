Blabber is a basic Rails 4 application that allows you to connect to people you might not know. 

Sign in, look through the list of users, and select people to become friends with for 1 on 1 chats!

Building the app taught me that applications that appear "simple" in use can be incredibly complex to construct. 

You can see a running version of the application at http://blabber.herokuapp.com/
